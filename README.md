The MongoDB driver for Go
-------------------------

This fork has had a few improvements by ourselves as well as several PR's merged from the original mgo repo that are currently awaiting review.
Changes are mostly geared towards performance improvements and bug fixes, though a few new features have been added.

Further PR's (with tests) are welcome, but please maintain backwards compatibility.

Detailed documentation of the API is available at
[GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/bukalapak/mgo).

A [sub-package](https://godoc.org/github.com/bukalapak/mgo/bson) that implements the [BSON](http://bsonspec.org) specification is also included, and may be used independently of the driver.
